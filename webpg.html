      The Minister for Social Justice & Empowerment Shri Thawaarchand Gehlot
      launched the website for the Nasha Mukt Bharat Abhiyaan (NMBA) on the
      occasion of International Day Against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking
      on 26 June 2021, which isobserved worldwide to strengthen action and
      cooperation in achieving the goal of a sustainable world free of substance
      abuse. The entire world is facing the menace of drug addiction which has a
      devastating impact on the addict, individual, family and a large section
      of society. The launch of Nasha Mukt Bharat Abhiyaan (NMBA) is for 272
      Districts across 32 State/Union Territories that have been identified as
      the most vulnerable in terms of usage of drugs in the country. These
      vulnerable districts were identified on the basis of findings from the
      Comprehensive National Survey and the inputs provided by the Narcotics
      Control Bureau (NCB). According to the National Comprehensive Survey
      conducted by the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment, there are
      more than 60 million drug users in the country of which a large number of
      users are in the age group of 10-17 years. OBJECTIVES Nasha Mukt Bharat
      Abhiyaan intends to reach out to the masses and spread awareness about
      substance abuse through various activities like: Awareness generation
      programmes Focus on higher educational Institutions, university campuses
      and schools Reaching out to the Community and identifying dependent
      population Focus on counselling and treatment facilities in hospitals and
      rehabilitation centres that have been geo-tagged Capacity building
      programmes for service providers INITIATIVES The Ministry of Social
      Justice and Empowerment has been mandated to reduce drug demand. It
      coordinates and oversees all aspects of drug abuse prevention including
      assessment of the extent of the problem, preventive action, treatment and
      rehabilitation of addicts, dissemination of information, and public
      awareness and is mandated to run de-addiction centres. Nasha Mukt Bharat
      Abhiyaan is operational with the involvement of more than 500 voluntary
      organizations across the country, which are assisted financially under the
      National Action Plan for Drug Demand Reduction (NAPDDR) scheme of the
      Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment. These NGOs have been actively
      involved in the implementation of Drug-Free India campaign. Nearly 8000
      youth volunteers and outreach workers of these institutions/organizations
      have gone from door to door, village to village and nearby localities,
      etc. to educate the people about the ill effects of drug abuse and have
      assisted in the rehabilitation of victims of substance abuse. The Nasha
      Mukt Bharat Abhiyaan website provides detailed information about the
      Abhiyaan and its activities, gives glimpses through the Photo & video
      gallery, provides IEC resource material and information on the
      institutions set up by the Ministry with the aim of Drug Demand reduction.
      The "Nasha Mukti Bharat Abhiyaan," also known as the "Anti-Drug Campaign
      of India," is a comprehensive and multifaceted initiative launched by the
      Indian government to combat the pervasive issue of substance abuse and
      addiction in the country. This ambitious campaign encompasses a wide range
      of strategies, programs, and policies aimed at preventing drug abuse,
      providing treatment and rehabilitation for addicts, raising awareness
      about the dangers of drug abuse, and enforcing strict laws against drug
      trafficking and distribution. One of the primary objectives of the Nasha
      Mukti Bharat Abhiyaan is to create a society that is free from the
      clutches of addiction, where individuals can lead healthy, productive
      lives. To achieve this goal, the campaign focuses on prevention as a
      cornerstone of its strategy. It includes educational programs and
      awareness campaigns targeted at schools, colleges, and communities to
      educate people, especially the youth, about the risks associated with drug
      abuse. These initiatives aim to instill a sense of responsibility and
      awareness among individuals, empowering them to make informed decisions
      and resist peer pressure. In addition to prevention efforts, the campaign
      places a strong emphasis on treatment and rehabilitation services for
      those already struggling with addiction. Recognizing addiction as a
      disease that requires medical attention, the Nasha Mukti Bharat Abhiyaan
      promotes the establishment and strengthening of de-addiction centers and
      rehabilitation facilities across the country. These centers offer a range
      of services, including detoxification, counseling, therapy, and vocational
      training to help individuals recover from addiction and reintegrate into
      society as productive citizens. The campaign also addresses the crucial
      issue of stigmatization and social reintegration of recovering addicts. It
      recognizes that societal attitudes play a significant role in an
      individual's journey to recovery and, therefore, strives to reduce the
      stigma associated with addiction. Community-based support networks and
      initiatives are promoted to facilitate the reintegration of recovering
      addicts into their families and communities, allowing them to rebuild
      their lives with dignity and support. Furthermore, Nasha Mukti Bharat
      Abhiyaan collaborates with various stakeholders, including
      non-governmental organizations (NGOs), healthcare professionals, and the
      private sector, to create a coordinated and synergistic approach to
      tackling drug addiction. This collaborative effort ensures that resources
      and expertise are pooled together to provide comprehensive support to
      those affected by addiction. It also encourages the active involvement of
      civil society in advocating for drug-free communities and assisting in the
      implementation of various campaign activities. The campaign's success is
      contingent on robust law enforcement measures to curb drug trafficking and
      distribution. Nasha Mukti Bharat Abhiyaan advocates for stringent
      anti-drug laws and their effective enforcement to disrupt the supply chain
      of illicit drugs. It collaborates with law enforcement agencies to conduct
      crackdowns on drug manufacturers, traffickers, and dealers, thereby
      reducing the availability of drugs in the market. By targeting the root
      causes of drug addiction and eliminating the sources of illegal
      substances, the campaign aims to make it more challenging for individuals
      to access drugs, ultimately reducing the incidence of addiction. The Nasha
      Mukti Bharat Abhiyaan recognizes that drug addiction is not limited to any
      specific region or demographic group and, as such, strives to create a
      national impact. It tailors its programs to address the unique needs and
      challenges faced by different states and communities across India. This
      approach ensures that the campaign is adaptable and responsive to the
      diverse cultural, economic, and social contexts in which drug abuse
      occurs. As part of its outreach efforts, the campaign leverages various
      media platforms to disseminate information and engage the public in
      anti-drug initiatives. Television, radio, social media, and print media
      are used to reach a wide audience and raise awareness about the
      consequences of drug abuse. These campaigns often feature testimonials
      from recovering addicts and their families, showcasing the transformative
      power of rehabilitation and recovery. The Nasha Mukti Bharat Abhiyaan also
      places a strong emphasis on research and data collection to continually
      assess the effectiveness of its programs and policies. Regular evaluations
      help identify areas that require improvement and provide valuable insights
      into the evolving nature of drug addiction in India. This evidence-based
      approach allows the campaign to adapt and refine its strategies over time,
      ensuring that it remains effective in addressing the ever-changing
      challenges posed by drug abuse. In conclusion, the Nasha Mukti Bharat
      Abhiyaan is a comprehensive and determined effort by the Indian government
      to combat the scourge of drug addiction that has plagued the nation for
      far too long. Through a multifaceted approach that encompasses prevention,
      treatment, law enforcement, and community engagement, the campaign seeks
      to create a drug-free India where individuals can lead healthy, fulfilling
      lives. While the road to a drug-free society is long and arduous, the
      Nasha Mukti Bharat Abhiyaan stands as a beacon of hope and commitment,
      striving to break the chains of addiction and offer a brighter future for
      all its citiz
